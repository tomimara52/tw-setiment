# tw-emotion

Script that reads someone's tweets and prints a short report  
on the general sentiment of those tweets.

It can translate tweets from Spanish to English for the analysis.  
You have to equal the 'is_spanish' variable to True for this.  

It uses the tweepy wraper library for the Twitter API.  
For the translation it uses the MyMemory API.
